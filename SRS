The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a communication tool between stakeholders and software designers. The specific goals of the SRS are:

Facilitating reviews
Describing the scope of work
Providing a reference to software designers (i.e. navigation aids, document structure)
Providing a framework for testing primary and secondary use cases
Including features to customer requirements
Providing a platform for ongoing refinement (via incomplete specs or questions)

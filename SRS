3.1 EXTERNAL INTERFACE REQUIREMENTS

This section provides a detailed description of all inputs into and outputs from the system. It also gives a
description of the hardware, software and communication interfaces and provides basic prototypes of the
user interface.
	
	3.1.1 USER INTERFACE-
As the user opens the app on her smart phone, she is prompted with two options on the first screen; 
vis. "choose an image from the gallery" and "detect your emotion", with a button corresponding to each one.

case 1-

If the user opts to choose an image from the gallery, the phone gallery gets opened and the user
can select one picture(max). If there are more than one faces in the picture, a prompt appears on 
the screen asking the user to change her preference. else, the selected photo gets loaded on the next 
screen (circular image on top middle). The user clicks "go" and the emotion associated with the selected 
image is detected and displayed on the screen.

case 2- 

User selects the second option and goes for real time emotion detection. Here, when the user 
clicks on the second button, front camera of the phone opens up and the user can see her emotion
being detected. This is noticed from the imoji of the associated becoming bigger and occupying the bottom of the screen.

The user can opt out of the app anytime by clicking on the red cross marked button on the top right of the screen. 

	3.1.2 HARDWARE INTERFACE REQUIREMEMTS
The following app has being designed for android phones (android 4.1+), having front camera of atleast 2 MP. 
There is as such no more hardware requirements; the real time detection is managed by the internal camera of 
the smart phone whereas the static image detection is managed by the gallery in the phone.


3.6 SOFTWARE SYSTEM ATTRIBUTES

	3.6.1 RELIABILITY

The following application is designed to be built and deployed on android platform, and will reliably run on
any android phone with android version above 4.1.The reliability of the app in emotion detection will depend 
primarily on the vastness of the training data, a requirement that needs to be taken care of on the developer
side while working on the project 


	3.6.2 AVAILABILITY

The application will be available for download on the google play store and will run 24*7 with or without internt connection.

	3.6.3 SECURITY 

Users of the app can in no way see the emotion results of other users without their prior knowledge and permission.
(__ sharing __ discuss later)  
	
	3.6.4 MAINTAINABILITY

Maintenance is one form of change that typically is done after the software development has been completed.
As the time changes, so do the needs. This application needs a timely updation of the expression and face
database suiting to the location where the app is intended to be used, and so the database needs to be expanded 
upon every updation of the app.As an example, for the app to show best results in emotion detection, training 
data comprising of faces from different parts of the world is needed, so as to facilitate better detection.
All this maintenence will be timely done on subsequent updations of the app by the admin.

	3.6.5 PORTABILITY

Since the app is built for portable android phones, it is freely portable and needs no re-download or update if 
it is to be used from some different location of the world.Also, the app can be freely transferred from one device 
to another, given that the other device complies to the hardware and software requirements as specified in section___.




FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT 

  Main screen - This will be the first screen that will be displayed.It will allow user to access different based upon user's preference.
  Various fields available on this screen will be. 
	1)Choose image - select images from user's gallery
	2)Do analysis(don't know exact name) - starts emotion detection using front camera.
  
  MODE 1(image analysis)
	
	-This screen will be accessible only if user has chosen an image from gallery. User shall 
	 either continue analysis or choose another image.
	
	-Searching for a single face from the image and showing user the selected region.If multiple
         faces are present user has to choose another image, he/she can't proceed further
		
	-If single face is detected in image by face detector and user is 
	satisfied with the image user can continue further.

	-This screen will appear if user has chosen an image for emotion detection .This screen shall
	 show the face under recognition and emotions detected in the image in decreasing order of most likely emotion.

	-User can exit the screen he/she shall be directed to main screen where user again has the same choices

  MODE 2(real time emotion detection)
		
	-This screen will be accessible only if user has chosen emotion analysis by front camera(don't know what exactly should go here).
 	 There shall be a button by clicking it user can start the analysis(I think we haven't discussed it but it is needed for sure)
	
	-Button to stop the analysis and it shall direct the user to main screen
	
	-Detection of face from the images. User has to focus front camera to only one face in case if there is multiple face detection.
	
	-Identification of various points on face which are usefull for emotion detection.

	-Emotion detection using the processed information and calculation of results.
	
	-There shall be a pie chart at the bottom of the screen showing the calculated value of the 
	user's emotion.

	-Pie chart will change it's shape dynamically if user will change it's emotion.
